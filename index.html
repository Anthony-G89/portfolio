            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Anthony Guerrero, I was born in <strong>Queens, NY</strong> and when I was 12 years old I moved to <strong>Orlando, FL</strong> and have been here since. I went to <em>Cypress Creek High School</em> and graduated in 2008.
            After that, I went to Valencia College with the intnention of majoring in Business Administration. But soon after, I realized it wasn't for me. I spent the next couple of years trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. During that time, I did hospitality for several years. I was fortunate to make cash daily, drive cars that some people have only seen in movies or online, and met some celebrities along the way. However, hospitality is not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I envisioned my future and what I wanted, I always heard about coding but never really paid much mind to it. Until, two years ago, when I decided to look into coding and seeing what other careers looked like. After I did my research and started watching videos of people coding I fell in love and finally knew what I wanted to do with my life. It only took 28 years of my life but I'm glad that I didn't rush into my major and spent thousands of dollars for a career that I wasn't going to be happy with. </p>
